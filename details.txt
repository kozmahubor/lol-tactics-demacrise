*   **Main Hub:** The capital city you are building is **Zeffira**.
*   **Acts:**
    *   *Act I:* The Founding of Demacia (Available now).
    *   *Act II:* Treats from Beyond (Coming soon).

## **2. THE CORE LOOP & LOGIC**
The game operates on a strictly **Turn-Based System** linked to your activity in the main *League of Legends* game.

### **The "Silver Shield" Economy (Time/Energy System)**
To play the game, you need **Silver Shields**.
*   **Earning Shields:** You earn **150 Shields** for every 60 minutes of LoL or TFT played (300 if you own the Pass).
*   **Spending Shields:** Ending a turn costs **10 Silver Shields**.
*   **Logic:** You play LoL to earn "time" to progress your Demacian city.

### **The Turn Sequence**
When you click "End Turn" (Sun Icon), the following logic executes in order:
1.  **Production:** All resource buildings generate their specific yield.
2.  **Construction:** Buildings under construction progress by 1 turn.
3.  **Movement:** Units on the map move closer to their destination.
4.  **Training:** Units in Barracks progress their training timer.
5.  **Events:** World Events or Combat Threats are triggered.

*Tip: You can use the "Undo" button (circular arrow) to reset actions taken in the *current* turn before you finalize it.*

## **3. RESOURCES & MANAGEMENT**
You must balance multiple currencies to expand. Production is viewed in the top status bar.

| Resource | Source | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food** | Farms | Increases **Army Size Cap**. Each unit consumes 1 Food slot permanently. |
| **Lumber** | Lumberyards | Building structures, repairing, and training basic units (Archers/Guards). |
| **Stone** | Quarries | Upgrading buildings and training mid-tier units. |
| **Metal** | Forges | High-tier structures and heavy units. |
| **Petricite** | Petricite Mills | High-tier research and elite units. |
| **Valor** | Victories/Expansion | **Research Currency**. Earned by settling towns, winning battles, and events. |
| **Silver Shields** | LoL Gameplay | Ending turns (10 cost) and researching Kingdom Upgrades. |

**Strategic Logic:**
*   **Town Environments:** Certain locations grant bonuses. E.g., placing a Farm in a "Heartland Town" yields extra food.
*   **Demolition:** You can destroy buildings if you need the slot for a different resource, though this wastes the turns spent building it.

---

## **4. STRUCTURES**
Most structures require unlocking via the **Blue Research Tree**.

*   **Barracks:** (300 Lumber, 150 Stone) – Trains units.
*   **Lumberyard:** (Default) – Produces Lumber (15/30/75 per turn based on level).
*   **Farm:** (Default) – Grants Food Slots (1/2/3 slots based on level).
*   **Quarry:** (100 Lumber) – Produces Stone (10/20/50 per turn).
*   **Forge:** (100 Lumber, 75 Stone) – Produces Metal (5/10/25 per turn).
*   **Quartermaster:** (250 Shields, 3 Valor, 100 Stone) – **Combat Buff:** Units in this settlement or neighbors deal +25% Damage.

## **5. UNITS & COMBAT**
Combat is **Auto-Play**. You must prepare your army *before* the fight starts.

### **Unit Types**
*   **Guard:** (Melee) Cheap, spear-wielders. *Cost: 1 Food, 50 Lumber.*
*   **Archer:** (Ranged) High damage, low health. *Cost: 1 Food, 75 Lumber.*
*   **Soldier:** (Tank) Shield-bearers, front-line blockers. *Cost: 1 Food, 70 Stone, 50 Metal.*
*   **Champions:** Unique Hero units unlocked via **Gold Research**.

### **Champion Availability**
*   **Poppy:** Unlocked after Prologue. (Stuns enemies).
*   **Morgana:** Unlocked in Chapter 2 (Zeffira Lvl 2). (AoE Damage/Tormented Soil).
*   **Kayle & Galio:** Unlocked in Chapters 3 & 4.

### **Combat Mechanics**
1.  **Deployment:** Units take time to travel between settlements. Plan ahead.
2.  **Raiding:** You click an enemy territory to scout their power. If you win, you claim the land.
3.  **Defending:** Random events will send enemies to attack *your* settlements. You must move units there before the turn timer expires.
4.  **Stats:** Units have specific counters (e.g., Shields block Archers). Research upgrades increase "Platoon Size" (number of soldiers in one unit) or raw stats.

## **6. THE RESEARCH TREE**
Research is the primary progression system, accessed via the bottom-right panel. It is gated by the **Level of Zeffira** (your main city).

*   **<span style="color:green">GREEN (System):</span>** Meta-rewards. Tracks Pass ownership and external bonuses.
*   **<span style="color:blue">BLUE (Kingdom):</span>** Economy efficiency. Unlocks new buildings (Quarry/Forge) and boosts resource yields.
*   **<span style="color:red">RED (Combat):</span>** Military might. Unlocks new units (Archers/Soldiers) and stat buffs.
*   **<span style="color:gold">GOLD (Champions):</span>** Unlocks Hero units. *Note: Champions must still be trained at a Barracks after unlocking.*

**Chain Logic:** Research is linear. You must unlock "Increase Platoon Size I" to unlock "Piercing Strikes."
